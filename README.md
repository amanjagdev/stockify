# Stockify

---

***Made for Atmanirbhar Bharat Hackathon***

This was a project intended to make the life of Warehouse owners easy by providing them with a Dashboard with clean UI and simple interface where Warehouse owner can keep a track of all their current stocks present in the Warehouse and soon the option for normal user to find near vacant Warehouses to store stuff.
We intend to include features like Graphical representation of stocks present and activity charts based on previous activities of stock addition and removal. As this a Web Based Application so warehouse owners can have all their data synced across their devices.

**Made on MERN Stack**
